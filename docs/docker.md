# Docker Starter Guide

## 📌 Introduction
This guide provides essential Docker commands for managing **images, containers, volumes, networks, and logs**. Use this as a reference for setting up and working with Docker efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ Docker Installation

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications into containers. Below are the steps to install Docker on different operating systems.

### 🔹 Install Docker on macOS via Homebrew
```sh
brew install --cask docker
```
- `--cask` : Installs GUI applications or software requiring additional setup, like Docker Desktop, which includes the Docker daemon.

Alternatively, Docker can be installed without the `--cask` flag:
```sh
brew install docker
```
- Installs the CLI version of Docker without Docker Desktop.

After installation, start Docker from the Applications folder or run:
```sh
open -a Docker
```

### 🔹 Install Docker on Windows (Official Website)
Download and install Docker from the official website:
[Docker Install for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

### 🔹 Check if Docker is installed
```sh
docker --version
```

### 🔹 Start the Docker service if not running
```sh
docker info
```

---

## 📦 Docker Image Management

Docker images are the blueprint for running containers. These commands help manage images efficiently.

### 🔹 List all images
```sh
docker images
```
- Displays all locally stored Docker images.

### 🔹 Pull an image from Docker Hub
```sh
docker pull nginx:alpine
```
- Downloads the `nginx:alpine` image from Docker Hub.

### 🔹 Build an image from a Dockerfile
```sh
docker build -t my-app .
```
- `-t my-app` : Assigns a name (tag) to the image.
- `.` : Uses the current directory as the build context.

### 🔹 Remove an image
```sh
docker rmi my-app
```
- Deletes the specified Docker image.

---

## 🏗️ Docker Container Management

Containers are instances of images that run applications. These commands help manage containers.

### 🔹 Run a container
```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-container nginx
```
- `-d` : Runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 80:80` : Maps port 80 on the container to port 80 on the host.
- `--name my-container` : Assigns a custom name to the container.

### 🔹 List running containers
```sh
docker ps
```
- Shows only currently running containers.

### 🔹 List all containers (including stopped ones)
```sh
docker ps -a
```
- Displays all containers, whether running or stopped.

### 🔹 Stop a running container
```sh
docker stop my-container
```
- Gracefully stops a running container.

### 🔹 Restart a container
```sh
docker restart my-container
```
- Stops and starts the container again.

### 🔹 Remove a container
```sh
docker rm my-container
```
- Deletes the specified container.

### 🔹 Remove all stopped containers
```sh
docker container prune
```
- Deletes all stopped containers to free up space.

---

## 🔍 Logs & Debugging

Debugging and monitoring container logs help troubleshoot issues efficiently.

### 🔹 View container logs
```sh
docker logs my-container
```
- Displays logs generated by the container.

### 🔹 Enter a running container
```sh
docker exec -it my-container sh
```
- `-it` : Runs in interactive mode.
- `sh` : Opens a shell inside the container.

### 🔹 Check container resource usage
```sh
docker stats
```
- Shows real-time CPU, memory, and network usage of running containers.

---

## 🗂️ Volumes & Cleanup

Docker volumes store persistent data. Proper cleanup helps manage disk space efficiently.

### 🔹 List all volumes
```sh
docker volume ls
```
- Displays all created Docker volumes.

### 🔹 Remove a volume
```sh
docker volume rm my-volume
```
- Deletes the specified volume.

### 🔹 Remove all unused images, containers, and volumes
```sh
docker system prune -a
```
- Frees up disk space by removing unused resources.

---

## 🌐 Docker Network

Docker networks enable communication between containers. By default, Docker creates a `bridge` network, but custom networks can be created for better isolation.

### 🔹 List networks
```sh
docker network ls
```
- Displays all Docker networks.

### 🔹 Create a new network
```sh
docker network create my-network
```
- Creates a custom network.

### 🔹 Run a container in a custom network
```sh
docker run -d --name my-app --network my-network nginx
```
- Connects the container to `my-network`.

---

## 🚀 Running Nginx with Docker

Nginx is a widely used web server. Below are different ways to deploy it with Docker.

### **Basic Nginx Container**
```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx-server nginx:alpine
```
- Runs an Nginx container on port 80.

### **Using a Custom `nginx.conf`**
```sh
# Create a custom config file
nano nginx.conf
```
Example `nginx.conf`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
}
```

### **Modify Dockerfile to Use Custom Nginx Config**
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### **Build and Run**
```sh
docker build -t my-nginx-app .
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-nginx my-nginx-app
```

Access the app at **http://localhost**

---

## 🔥 Cleanup and Stopping Docker

Proper cleanup ensures efficient resource management.

### 🔹 Stop all running containers
```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```
- Stops all currently running containers.

### 🔹 Remove all containers
```sh
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```
- Deletes all containers, including stopped ones.

### 🔹 Remove all images
```sh
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```
- Deletes all local images.
