## **Document 1: Data Collection & Ingestion**

### **Overview**
Data Collection & Ingestion is the foundation for dynamic training. It involves continuously gathering raw data from multiple sources and streaming it into the system to ensure that the most up-to-date information is available for model training.

### **Objectives**
- Continuously collect data from various sources (APIs, databases, streaming sources).
- Automate data ingestion pipelines to capture real-time or near-real-time updates.
- Store data in a structured, version-controlled repository for downstream processing.

### **Key Tasks**
1. **Identify Data Sources**  
   - Internal databases (SQL, NoSQL)  
   - Files (CSV, JSON)  
   - APIs & web scraping  
   - Streaming platforms (Kafka, Google Pub/Sub)

2. **Set Up Data Pipelines**  
   - Use ETL/ELT tools (e.g., **Apache Airflow**, **Google Cloud Dataflow**) to schedule and orchestrate data ingestion.
   - Implement real-time streaming where applicable (e.g., Apache Kafka, Google Pub/Sub) to continuously update the dataset.

3. **Data Storage & Versioning**  
   - Store raw data in a data lake (e.g., **Google Cloud Storage**, **AWS S3**) with versioning enabled.
   - Maintain metadata (e.g., timestamps, source identifiers) for tracking data lineage.

4. **Data Governance**  
   - Ensure compliance with privacy and security regulations (GDPR, HIPAA).
   - Use a data catalog to document and manage data sources and their versions.

### **Best Practices**
- **Automation**: Automate ingestion using scheduling tools (Airflow, Cloud Scheduler) to capture both batch and streaming data.

Not every new model version will perform as expected. A robust rollback and experimentation framework is critical to safely test new models and quickly revert to a stable version if issues arise.

### **Objectives**
- Safely deploy new model versions while allowing for quick rollback.
- Experiment with new models using A/B testing or canary releases.
- Maintain an audit trail of experiments, metrics, and decisions for future reference.

### **Key Tasks**
1. **Versioned Deployments**  
   - Deploy new models in parallel (canary or blue-green deployments) to a small subset of traffic.
   - Monitor performance and compare against the stable version.

2. **A/B Testing**  
   - Set up experiments to test multiple model versions simultaneously.
   - Use statistical analysis to determine if the new model outperforms the current one.

3. **Rollback Mechanism**  
   - Implement automated rollback strategies in your deployment pipeline.
   - Ensure that rolling back to a previous version is fast and minimally disruptive.

4. **Experiment Tracking**  
   - Log all experiments, including configurations, metrics, and outcomes.
   - Use tools to visualize and compare different model versions over time.

### **Best Practices**
- **Automated Rollback**: Use automated triggers to revert to the previous model if critical metrics fall below acceptable levels.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of experiments and decisions for regulatory and audit purposes.
- **Incremental Rollouts**: Gradually increase the traffic to new models to monitor real-world performance before full deployment.

### **Tools & References**
